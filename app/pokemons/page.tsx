			<h1>Welcome to our Safe Association for Pokemon</h1>
			<h2>
				where pokemons can be bought and sold, legally and in all concerns for
				their safety and happiness !
			</h2>

			<p>
				Pokemons are usually treated as objects and have less than ideal
				conditions with the reducted space they are confined in.
			</p>

			<p>
				At S.A.P. we make it our priority that everyone can sell and buy
				pokemons that are in good health and that can answer their needs :
				whether it is company or fighters to continue on their way to Glory. But
				first, let us guide you through a few guide lines.
